I am Daniel Gu, and I am a computer science student at Xi'an Jiaotong University. I plan to use this blog to post my tech ideas.

This simple blog platform is created using Python and Flask as backend, and no database is used. I planned to add comment function to it, so that you can leave comments to it later.

I am planning my first blog series: *Build Your Own OS on Your Own CPU*. Appologies that I am still a student that cannot devote a lot of time to that, and the update speed might be very slow. You can email me at [my email](mailto:endaytrer@gmail.com) to give me advices or compliants. Thank you so much!
