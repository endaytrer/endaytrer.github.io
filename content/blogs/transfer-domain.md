As my website is approaching its one-year birthday, the old domain `endaytrer.com` will be expired next month. I want to change to a domain name that is **more memorable**, reflecting **my identity** more clearly, and **freer** (as in freedom). [danielgu.org](/) naturally becomes my first choice, satisfying all my requirements. 

I used to consider a shorter domain `zrgu.org` as part of my legal name Zhenrong Gu, however it is hard to read out loud; `zhenronggu.org` is also one of my choice, but I think it is longer and hard for non-Chinese people to pronounce and remember.

As I'm becoming a grad student, I might will soon use the main page for my academic homepage; and a dedicated subdomain for my blog and personal home page (maybe blog.danielgu.org or something like that.), but this change won't happen, since I do not have time to make a new webpage now :(
